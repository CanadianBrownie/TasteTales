**Name:** Blueberry Cream Cheese Pancake\
**Review:** The pancake was pretty standard. Was not super fluffy or absorbent. The cheese creams was good balance of cheesy and creamy mix. The syrup was good. Tasted like a caramel syrup mixture. The berries felt they were frozen and then thawed where it lost crispiness of blueberries, it had a watery taste.  Might have been nicer to be just frozen blue berries. The nuts were a nice touch. \
**Rating:** 7.4 /10

**Name:** Cappuccino \
**Review:**  Was overly bitter. Felt the milk was very little or light. The foam wasn’t as creamy. No roasted coffee feeling. Maybe it was a bit rushed. Wasn’t the biggest fan of it. \
**Rating:** 4.5 /10

**Name:** Signature Flippers Soufflé Pancake\
**Review:**  The pancake was very fluffy and nice to cut into, but there was a taste of egg which I wasn’t a fan of. The cream was good, ice cream cheesy like flavor. The cream added good balance to the cake.\
**Rating:** 5.3 /10

**Name:** Blue Ice Tea Lemonade \
**Review:**  It’s not too bad it grows on you kind of thing but has an odd after taste. Sort of cinnamon like. Not sure what the berry was\
**Rating:** 6.2

**Overall Food Rating:** 5.85 /10

**Restaurant Vibe:** There was a bit of a long wait, but since I went on opening weekend that can be expected (-.15). The server was very nice but when given the menu he had no idea the soufflé pancake was not available at that time, even though the hostess mentioned it was not. The restaurant was relatively clean and a very small space. Had a modern boutique look and feel to it. The table we sat in was pretty small. Sat against the window on a small table.\
**Additional Notes:** They gave out free tote bags with stickers inside, my guess since it is opening weekend. The owner was individually talking to everyone as they were closing up. She also gave us a free sample of the souffle pancake since it was not available to order so likely they made some rush order of ingredients (+.5). I would go to try this one. Friend go the waffle and fried chick. Had a small bite of the chicken and that was really good.

![](BreakfastBrunch/KarKumiCafe_BeefShortRibsEggsBenedict.jpeg)
**Name:** Beef Short Rib Eggs Benedict\
**Review:** Too many greens. They had a sweet flavoring to it, which tasted good by itself, but mixing it other dishes doesn't work well.  The wedges were pretty well baked and well seasoned. But they weren’t evenly seasoned so some had more seasoning than others.  The eggs Benedict was really good and had nice taste to it. I liked the beef a lot too. The bread was kind of soggy which I didn’t like, but could have been due to how long I left it. \
**Rating:** 8.6 /10

**Name:** Tiramisu Latte\
**Review:** Flavoring wise it pretty okay, it is regular cold brew with some whipped foam and tiramisu shavings. The tiramisu didn't really taste like it, was more like brown sugar. The cold brew is what you expect out of cold brew nothing spectacular, but decently flavored. Not too bitter good mixture. Came with a biscuit which tasted good dipped in. The biscuit was the better part of it.\

**Restaurant Vibe:** The restaurant has a small café vibe. Very clean and very well kept. Not much personality. Has a more modern look to it. They used pretty fancy cutely and plating.  The food we ordered had good presentation to it. Seems where more of the price of the food goes to.  My dish came pretty quickly. But we were a group and it took some time for others to come by, but that could have been cause he had issues ordering. Menu is fully digital, both for looking and ordering.  No waiter needs to come to table and you order when you are ready.  Payment is done through machine.  No forced gratuity, even though we were a group of 8, the minimum tip was 12% \
**Additional Notes:** The washroom was well kept, and was clean.  They have two multi-gender washrooms. It had a glow light mirror.
**Restaurant rating:** 8.5 /10\
**Overall Price:** $32.91 (12%) tip

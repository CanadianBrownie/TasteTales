**Name:** Americano with a bit of cream\
**Review:** It was really bad, the thing that you would necer want to get again kind of bad. It tasted worse than black coffee, idk how that is even possible. I will give that no one is coming here for the coffee, but why is it on the menu if it is that bad.I would come back for their pasteries and ice cream but coffee idk.\
**Rating:** 2/10

----

**Restaurant Vibe:** The restaurant it self has a really nice clean vibe to it. It is mostly a pastry shop and it is small. It has two sections, one for ice cream and one for their pasteries, they both have separate entrances. I have been here a few times before and tried out other menu items.\
**Additional Notes:** N/A\
**Restaurant rating:** 5/10 \
**Overall Price:** $4.00

**Name:** Matcha Iced Latte\
**Review:** 5.5/10\
**Rating:** It felt it was not super well mixed. There was a strong bitter taste in the beginning. After mixing it myself, there was a subtle matcha tast to it and that was nice. They used small ice cubes and if you don't ask for less ice the pack the cups is packed with ice like a full cup of. The latte itself had some graininess to it which really was off putting to the texture.

**Restaurant Vibe:** The restaurant is nice, it feels more authentic than those modern cafes, they have (I believe) ethiopean artwork on the walls, and it feels more homey cafe vibe.\
**Additional Notes:** I would like to try their other menu items\
**Restaurant rating:** 7/10\
**Overall Price:** $6.18

## %Arabica

![](Coffee/%Arabica_KyotoIcedLatte.jpeg)
**Name:** Kyoto Iced Latte\
**Review:** The latter was okay, nothing that would blow you out with the taste the way the atmosphere gives you, but also not too bad. There were bit of syrup which could have been because it was not mixed properly, but haveing the bursts of syrup added a nice touch to it.\
**Rating:** 7/10

----

**Restaurant Vibe:** The place is more about the atomosphere and look and feel than the coffee in particular. The restaurant is all white with mix of coffee like colors. But even though it is supposed to have a pristine look it not super clean and well kept.\
**Restaurant rating:** 5/10\
**Overall Price:** $7.85
